# math-quiz

# This is a math quiz. 

# You have three attempts, and if you use them all, you will fail the quiz, but if you score "50" or more, you will pass. 
 
# Before you begin, you must select an operator; each operator will be assigned a different score: 2 points for addition and subtraction, 4 points for multiplication and division.

# There is also a "show answer" button if you really don't know the solution; you can show the answer as long as you have 3 or more scores for addition and subtraction and 5 or more scores for multiplication and division.
